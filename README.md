Streamlined business loan app with real-time approval status &amp; financial assessment.
The Business Loan Application System is a simple and user-friendly web application built using Python and Flask. It allows businesses to apply for loans by providing essential information such as business name, year established, loan amount, and accounting provider. 
Upon submission, the system assesses the application based on predefined rules, including profit history and asset values. If the application meets the criteria, it displays a "Pre-Approved" status along with the provided business details. 
This system not only simplifies the loan application process but also provides quick feedback on the application's eligibility, streamlining the decision-making process for both applicants and lenders.
